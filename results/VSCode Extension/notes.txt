VSCODE EXTENSION 
- runs planning.domain planner (can connect others if want)
- can choose parser
- generates graphical representation of type hierarchy (pretty cool - would be nice to have something like this for HDDL task hierarchy since much more complex & confusing)
- also generates graphical representation of solutions
- seemed to be delayed in recognising when problems appear/have been removed - problem messages would still be in the list of problems long after the file had been closed
- very annoying trying to link problem and domain files - often won't recognise when both are open
- seems to run pretty slowly - pretty intense for computer
